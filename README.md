# Veterinary-Telemedicine
This  project is seeing to  bringing together all veterinarians and animal owners around the world on an interface to give care to companion animals(dogs, cats, horses) and food animals(cattles, sheep and goats) from anywhere all over the world , without having to visit the hospital physically to give care to them.
